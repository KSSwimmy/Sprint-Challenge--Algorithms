#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n) because we only run 1 operation and we loop through our operation n times

b)0(n^2) because we have a nested operation a while loop within a for loop

c)Though were invoking a function within a function 0 complexity would still be 0(n)

## Exercise II
